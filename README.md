# Seasonal-Theme

Have you ever had trouble knowing what season you're existing in?  Think no further.  As soon as you open a browser session, you will know if it's winter, spring, summer, or fall.

An Open Source extension for Mozilla Firefox that will **change the theme** of your Firefox browser representing the **season** based on the **time of the year**.
