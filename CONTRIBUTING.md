The "Page Repository" repository has source code for a Mozilla Firefox extension that lets an user know how many unique pages
visited per browser session.  

We welcome any contributions.  They include improving our implementation and improving or chaning the idea.  Perhaps, one can 
define unique pages differently as mlb.com and mlb.com/scores for example may count as "one."

# Types of Contributions

There are many ways of improving this repository folks.  As mentioned above:
1. You can improve the code.
2. You can change the definition of unique pages as long it makes sense and make code changes correspondingly.
3. Any bug fixes or unmentioned yet reasonable fixes are welcome.
