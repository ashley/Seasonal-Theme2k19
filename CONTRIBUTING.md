The "Seasonal-Theme" repository has source code for a Mozilla Firefox extension that lets the user know what season it is based on the user's time. 

We welcome any contributions.  They include improving our implementation and improving or chaning the idea.  Perhaps, one can 
find any loopholes regarding timezone as the date in USA and that in another part of the world may result in different seasons.

### Types of Contributions

There are many ways of improving this repository folks.  As mentioned above:

> 1. You can improve the code.
> 2. You can change the definition of unique pages as long it makes sense and you can make code changes correspondingly.
> 3. Any bug fixes or unmentioned yet reasonable fixes are welcome. 

### Guidelines
