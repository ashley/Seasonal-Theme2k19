The "Page-Counter" repository has source code for a Mozilla Firefox extension that lets an user know how many unique pages
visited per browser session.  

We welcome any contributions.  They include improving our implementation and improving or chaning the idea.  Perhaps, one can 
define unique pages differently as mlb.com and mlb.com/scores for example may count as "one."

# Types of Contributions

There are many ways of improving this repository folks.  As mentioned above:
1. You can improve the code.
2. You can change the definition of unique pages as long it makes sense and you can make code changes correspondingly.
3. Any bug fixes or unmentioned yet reasonable fixes are welcome. 

# Guidelines
Your examples / contributions should:
* be clear
* demonstrate good use of web technologies

# Code Style
Generally your code should flow well with existing code but exceptions exist.  If your web framework or technology significantly improves our implementation, please don't refrain from suggesting your patch.
